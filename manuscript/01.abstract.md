## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Though effective therapies exist for melanoma, resistance to these drugs inevitably develops. Previous studies have shown that resistance arises from rare cancer cells that are reprogrammed from a pre-resistant state. Several genes, including EGFR, NGFR, and AXL, are disproportionately expressed in pre-resistant cells and have been comprehensively profiled through knockout models and gene expression measurement. However, the broader regulatory events by which a cell enters this rare state are unclear. A unified model for how these components interact would help uncover drivers of this process. We built an ordinary differential equation model of the concentrations of mRNA corresponding to pre-resistant genes. We used this as a data-driven framework to identify gene-gene interactions by allowing all possible interactions, then comparing to gene expression measurements from each knockout using optimization implemented in Julia. The interaction parameters inferred by the model can be used to identify key regulators driving melanoma drug resistance development.
