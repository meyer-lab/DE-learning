### Perturbation model
The model was constructed using Julia 1.5.0. The levels of mRNA in response to different perturbations are described by a unified system of ordinary differential equations. In this equation, $x_{i}^\mu$ represents the expression level of each gene under a specific knockout condition $\mu$. $\omega$ is a matrix representing interactions between different genes, specifically, $\omega_{ij}$ indicate interaction between gene j on gene i. To simulate the knockout condition, the corresponding column in $\omega$ is set to 0. All the elements in $\omega$ are also assumed to be constant after the introduction of a specific perturbation. We use function $\mathit{1 + tanh( )}$ to model the saturation effect of the interaction term and avoid negative values. Then $\epsilon$ is used as a saturation coefficient to bound the whole interaction term. Finally, we use $\alpha$ to characterize the degradation rate of each mRNA. The initial values of state variables x are approximated by $\mathit{\epsilon / \alpha}$, derived from steady-state assumption of the ODE equation while ignoring the effect of the $\omega$ matrix. The ODE system was numerically solved using $\mathit{AutoVern7}$ Method with low tolerance. In addition, the Jacobian matrix of the ODE equation was symbolically calculated and provided to the ODE solver to increase the speed. The model performance was evaluated by difference between RNA-Seq Data and simulation output (the comparison was also visualized by using scatterplot of Model outputs vs RNA-Seq Measurements).




### Fused perturbation solving
The fitting of the model begins by initializing $\omega$ and $\epsilon$ by assuming the model is at steady state(eqn.1). As a result, we obtained two functions allowing to directly calculate $\omega$ and $\epsilon$(eqn.2, 3). In the third equation, U represents the steady-state values across knockdowns and control while $B_{[i]} = tan^{-1}(\frac{\alpha\mu_{i}}{\epsilon} - 1)$.

$$d\mu = \epsilon \cdot (1 + tanh(\omega \cdot \mu)) - \alpha\mu = 0_{(1)}$$

$$\epsilon_{overall} = \frac{mean\:of\:(\alpha\mu)}{mean\:of\:(1+tanh(\omega \cdot \mu))} _{(2)}$$

$$\omega^{T} = U^{T} \ast B^{T}_{(3)}$$

By iteratively calculating the $\omega$ and $\epsilon$ given the data and $\alpha$ for ~ 20 cycles, we can obtain the optimally initialized parameters. These parameters are then passed to a cost function(eqn.4) that calculate the norm of deviation from steady-state values, ensuring the output of model is consistent with experiment data. 

$$cost = norm(\epsilon \cdot (1 + tanh(\omega\cdot\mu)) - \alpha\mu)_{(4)}$$

In order to enforce certain characteristics of $\omega$, three different types of regularization are added to the cost function: 1).L1 regularization(eqn.5) - To enforce that most genes should not interact with each other 2).Orthogonality(eqn.6) - To prevent parallelism of gene interaction 3).Dynamic(eqn.7) - To ensure 1 complex eigenvalue for oscillatory behavior. Finally, this cost function is passed to an optimization function along with its gradient function to minimize the cost by tweaking $\omega$ and $\epsilon$.

$$L1\:regularization = norm(\omega, axis = column)_{(5)}$$

$$Orthogonality = norm(\omega^{T} \ast \omega - I), where\:I\:is\:an\:identity\:matrix_{(6)}$$

$$Dynamic = sum(\gamma) - maximum(\gamma), where\: \gamma\: represents\: all\: the\: complex\: components\: in\: the\: Jacobian\: matrix\: of\: perturbation\: model_{(7)}$$
