### Perturbation model

The model was constructed using Julia 1.5.0. The levels of mRNA in response to different perturbations are described by a unified system of ordinary differential equations. In this equation, x_{i}^\mu represents the expression level of each gene under a specific knockout condition \mu. w is a matrix representing interactions between different genes, specifically, w_{ij} indicate interaction between gene j on gene i. To simulate the knockout condition, the corresponding column in w is set to 0. All the elements in w are also assumed to be constant after the introduction of a specific perturbation. We use function \mathit{1 + tanh( )} to model the saturation effect of the interaction term and avoid negative values. Then \epsilon is used as a saturation coefficient to bound the whole interaction term. Finally, we use \alpha to characterize the degradation rate of each mRNA. The initial values of state variables x are approximated by \mathit{\epsilon / \alpha}, derived from steady-state assumption of the ODE equation while ignoring the effect of the w matrix. The ODE system was numerically solved using \mathit{AutoVern7} Method with low tolerance. In addition, the Jacobian matrix of the ODE equation was symbolically calculated and provided to the ODE solver to increase the speed. The model performance was evaluated by difference between RNA-Seq Data and simulation output (the comparison was also visualized by using scatterplot of Model outputs vs RNA-Seq Measurements).
